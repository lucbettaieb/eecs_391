Current State:
    Things move.
    They walk into walls, or run away.
    
TODO:
    make AI less retarded.  Something to do with move generation.
    only sort children when we look at them, not at generation.
        move the call from getChildren to alphaBetaSearch, change to reference ActionApplier's applyHeuristic
    move each GameState heuristic weight magic number into a 'final const int' global declaration
