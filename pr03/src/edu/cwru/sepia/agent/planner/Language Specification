Planner and action agent will communicate using a simple language, rendered as a String.
    This ensures that the PEAgent output will work for grading.
    
Our STRIPS like planner can probably get away with 3 verbs: HARVEST, DEPOSIT, and MOVE.
    Finally, 4 direct objects are required: TOWNHALL, WOOD, GOLD, FOOD
    
Sample valid sentences:
    HARVEST1(WOOD)
    DEPOSIT1(WOOD, TOWNHALL)       alternatively, this could be simplified to DEPOSIT(WOOD)
    
    
Sample STRIPS stuff:

    HARVEST1(WOOD)
        preconditions:  empty(PEASANT1)
                        beside(PEASANT1, FOREST)
        add effects:    has1(WOOD)
        delete effects: empty(PEASANT1)
        
    DEPOSIT1(WOOD)
        preconditions:  has1(WOOD)
                        beside(PEASANT1, TOWNHALL)
        add effects:    empty(PEASANT1)
        delete effects: has1(WOOD)
        
        
        
To communicate with the action agent, only use the HARVEST, DEPOSIT, and MOVE verbs, 
and limit the nouns to those in the second paragraph.
All MOVE verbs will be ignored, as the agent will simply find the best location.
Parsing will take the verb, subject, direct object sentence and turn it into a compound action.
Preliminary checks will be done to move to the proper location, 
i.e. move to the closest nonempty forest to HARVEST WOOD.  
All DEPOSIT actions go to the same location (TOWNHALL), making the specification redundant.
We should choose this standard.
