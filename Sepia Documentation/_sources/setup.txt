Setup
=========

This document assumes that you are using Eclipse. Other IDEs such as
Intellij will work, but you will need to figure out the proper setup
instructions.

If you don't have eclipse you can go to `the Eclipse website <https://eclipse.org/users/>`_ and follow
the installation instructions for your operating system.

You will need to download the ``Sepia.jar`` file from the course website.

Eclipse Project Setup
-----------------

Open Eclipse and in the main menu click `file->new->Java
Project`. This should open a new dialogue window. Give your project a
name and then click finish.

You should now have a new project in the package explorer on the left
side of the screen. Click the arrow next to the package name to expand
the package and see its subfolders. You will now need to add the
sepia.jar to the build path of this project.

Right click on the project name and select `new->folder`. Call the
folder ``lib`` and click finish. Now drag the download Seipa.jar file
to lib folder and when prompted select the copy option.

small arrow on the left the lib folder to expand the folder.
