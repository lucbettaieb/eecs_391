JMIValidator
============

.. java:package:: matlabcontrol
   :noindex:

.. java:type::  class JMIValidator

   Validates that the methods used by \ :java:ref:`JMIWrapper`\  are present in the current Java Virtual Machine, which should always be MATLAB's JVM when this class is used. This is done because \ ``jmi.jar``\  is entirely undocumented and could change in any future release without notice. If that occurred it could result in a number of exceptions that could be insufficiently informative to resolve the issue. This class throws detailed exceptions when an expected method (or class the method belongs to) is not found.
