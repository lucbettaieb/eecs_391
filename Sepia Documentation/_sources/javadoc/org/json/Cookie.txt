Methods
-------
escape
^^^^^^

.. java:method:: public static String escape(String string)
   :outertype: Cookie

   Produce a copy of a string in which the characters '+', '%', '=', ';' and control characters are replaced with "%hh". This is a gentle form of URL encoding, attempting to cause as little distortion to the string as possible. The characters '=' and ';' are meta characters in cookies. By convention, they are escaped using the URL-encoding. This is only a convention, not a standard. Often, cookies are expected to have encoded values. We encode '=' and ';' because we must. We encode '%' and '+' because they are meta characters in URL encoding.

   :param string: The source string.
   :return: The escaped result.

toJSONObject
^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. java:method:: public static JSONObject toJSONObject(String string) throws JSONException
   :outertype: Cookie

   Convert a cookie specification string into a JSONObject. The string will contain a name value pair separated by '='. The name and the value will be unescaped, possibly converting '+' and '%' sequences. The cookie properties may follow, separated by ';', also represented as name=value (except the secure property, which does not have a value). The name will be stored under the key "name", and the value will be stored under the key "value". This method does not do checking or validation of the parameters. It only converts the cookie string into a JSONObject.

   :param string: The cookie specification string.
   :throws JSONException:
   :return: A JSONObject containing "name", "value", and possibly other members.

toString
^^^^^^^^

.. java:method:: public static String toString(JSONObject jo) throws JSONException
   :outertype: Cookie

   Convert a JSONObject into a cookie specification string. The JSONObject must contain "name" and "value" members. If the JSONObject contains "expires", "domain", "path", or "secure" members, they will be appended to the cookie specification string. All other members are ignored.

   :param jo: A JSONObject
   :throws JSONException:
   :return: A cookie specification string

unescape
^^^^^^^^

.. java:method:: public static String unescape(String string)
   :outertype: Cookie

   Convert \ ``%``\ \ *hh*\  sequences to single characters, and convert plus to space.

   :param string: A string that may contain \ ``+``\ Â (plus) and \ ``%``\ \ *hh*\  sequences.
   :return: The unescaped string.
