DeepEquatable
=============

.. java:type:: public interface DeepEquatable

   An alternative to the equals method. Needed because HashMaps are widely used and are optimized by only comparing the ID field, necessitating that hashCode() and thus equals() conform to that.  It is generic so that it can check at compile-time if the types are right.  This should be primarily used for debugging and testing purposes.
